# Creating Fault Reports

## Overview

Fault reports are the foundation of the repair process. Your detailed, accurate reports ensure service providers can quickly diagnose and fix equipment issues. As a Reporting Employee, you can create reports that your Site Budget Controller can then monitor and assign.

## When to Create a Report

- **Equipment Malfunction**: When equipment isn't working as expected
- **Safety Concerns**: If equipment poses a risk to safety
- **Maintenance Issues**: Preventive reporting for upcoming issues
- **Urgent Repairs**: High-priority breakdowns affecting operations

## Step-by-Step Report Creation

### 1. Access the New Report Form

- Log in to the application
- From the dashboard, click "Create New Report" or "Report Fault"
- On mobile, tap the + button in the bottom navigation

### 2. Select Equipment Location

- Choose the specific location where the faulty equipment is located
- If your organization has multiple sites/businesses, select the correct one
- This ensures the report goes to the right regional service providers

### 3. Enter Equipment Details

**Required Fields:**

- **Item Identifier**: Serial number, asset tag, or model identifier
- **Fault Description**: Detailed explanation of the problem
  - What you observed
  - When the issue started
  - Steps already taken
  - Impact on operations
  - Urgency level

**Optional Fields:**

- Equipment make and model
- Installation date
- Warranty information
- Additional context

### 4. Attach Supporting Media

- **Photos**: Multiple angles of the faulty equipment
  - General setup
  - Close-up of the specific issue
  - Any error codes or displays
  - Serial/model plates
- **Documents**: Manuals, maintenance records, or previous repair invoices
- **Tips**: Use good lighting, steady camera, and clear focus

### 5. Contact Information

- Provide the best person to contact for this specific job
- Include phone numbers and preferred contact times
- This person should be available for questions during repair

### 6. Review and Submit

- Double-check all details for accuracy
- Preview the report as it will appear to service providers
- Click "Submit Report"
- You'll receive a confirmation with a report number

## What Happens After Submission

### Immediate Actions

- Report is timestamped and logged
- Notification sent to your Site Budget Controller
- System begins matching approved service providers

### Within Hours/Days

- Budget Controller reviews and potentially assigns a service provider
- Provider receives notification with full report details
- Status updates automatically as work progresses

### Timeline Expectations

- **Assignment**: Within 1-2 business days (depending on priority)
- **Initial Contact**: Service provider contacts designated person
- **Repair**: Timeline depends on parts availability and complexity
- **Completion**: Final confirmation by your Budget Controller

## Editing Reports

You can edit your reports while they are in "Reported" status:

- Click on the report in "My Reports"
- Make necessary changes
- Save edits
- Once assigned to a provider, reports become read-only

## Best Practices for Report Creation

- **Be Specific**: "The oven doesn't heat to temperature" vs "Oven not working"
- **Include Context**: Business impact, urgency, safety concerns
- **Attach Media**: Photos are worth more than detailed descriptions
- **Provide Access**: Ensure repair person can access the equipment
- **Follow Up**: Contact your Budget Controller if no assignment within 48 hours

## Troubleshooting Report Issues

If your report doesn't submit:

- Check required fields are completed

- Ensure photo attachments are under size limits
