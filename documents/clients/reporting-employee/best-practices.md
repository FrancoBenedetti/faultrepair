# Best Practices for Reporting Employees

## Report Quality Guidelines

Creating high-quality fault reports ensures faster, more accurate repairs and better communication with service providers. Follow these guidelines to optimize your reporting process.

## Writing Effective Fault Descriptions

### Critical Information to Include

#### What Happened

- **Observable Symptoms**: What are you seeing/hearing/smelling? (e.g., " Oven not heating to set temperature")
- **When It Occurs**: Does it happen constantly or intermittently? (e.g., "Only occurs when using convection setting")
- **Gradual vs Sudden**: Did this develop over time or start suddenly?

#### Context and Impact

- **Business Impact**: How does this affect operations? (e.g., "Cannot cook breakfast order during morning rush")
- **Safety Concerns**: Any immediate risks to staff/customers?
- **Previous Occurrences**: Has this happened before? Solutions tried?

#### Equipment Details

- **Make/Model**: Specific manufacturer and model number
- **Age/Usage**: How long has equipment been installed? Usage patterns?
- **Error Codes/Messages**: Exact text from any digital displays

### Description Templates

#### Template 1 - Equipment Malfunction

"[Equipment] is not [function]. Issue started [when]. Symptoms include [observable details]. Business impact: [operational effect]. Have tried: [troubleshooting steps]."

#### Template 2 - Safety Issues

"URGENT: [Equipment] has [safety concern]. Occurs [when/under what conditions]. Immediate action required to prevent [risk]. Current workaround: [temporary solution]."

#### Template 3 - Performance Degradation

"[Equipment] performance has degraded since [when]. Previously [normal operation], now experiencing [symptoms]. All specifications/settings: [relevant details]."

## Photography Best Practices

### When to Attach Photos

- **Always required**: For visual equipment issues
- **Highly recommended**: Error codes, switches/indicators, faulty components
- **Helpful**: Overall setup, access points, installed environment

### Photo Guidelines

- **Multiple Angles**: Show the problem from different perspectives
- **Close-ups**: Detailed shots of fault location
- **Clear Focus**: Well-lit, sharp images
- **Context**: Show where equipment is installed
- **Scale**: Include a reference object for size
- **Documentation**: Serial plates, warning labels

### Photo Checklist

- [ ] Overall view of equipment setup
- [ ] Problem area - wide angle
- [ ] Problem area - close-up detail
- [ ] Control panel/display readings
- [ ] Serial number/model plate
- [ ] Access points/surrounding area

## Contact Information Selection

### Choosing the Right Contact Person

#### For Each Report

- **Technical Knowledge**: Person familiar with equipment settings
- **Availability**: Someone accessible during repair window
- **Decision Authority**: Can approve small changes or workarounds
- **Communication Skills**: Good at explaining technical issues

#### Contact Details

- **Primary Phone**: Most reliable contact number
- **Alternate Phone**: Backup if primary unavailable
- **Email**: For detailed communication or after-hours
- **Best Times**: When the contact is typically available

### Planning Ahead

- Maintain updated contact rotation among team
- Train backup contacts on common equipment terminology
- Update contact information when staff changes

## Understanding Approval Workflows

### Report Submission Process

1. **Submit Report** → Budget Controller notified
2. **Controller Review** → May assign provider directly or after selection
3. **Provider Assignment** → Work begins, status updates flow

### Your Role in Approval

- **Monitor Assignment**: Check if assigned within 2 business days
- **Escalate if Needed**: Contact controller for unassigned urgent reports
- **Provide Updates**: Notify controller of changing priorities

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Vague Descriptions

❌ "It's broken"
✅ "The commercial oven won't heat above 200°F when set to 350°F"

### Missing Context

❌ "Machine stopped working"
✅ "Food prep mixer seized during dough kneading, motor still works but mixer head won't turn. Happened during morning rush with 50lb dough load."

### Incomplete Contact Info

❌ No contact person specified
✅ "Contact: Sarah Johnson (Head Chef), Primary: 555-0101, Available: 6am-8am daily"

### Poor Photo Quality

❌ Blurry, poorly lit image from far away
✅ Multiple clear, well-lit photos including close-ups of error conditions

### Delayed Reporting

❌ Report safety issue that occurred last week
✅ Report immediately, even if temporary workarounds exist

## Mobile Reporting Tips

### Field Conditions

- **Clean Hands**: No oil/grease on phone screen during photo
- **Stable Camera**: Use both hands or tripod for clarity
- **Lighting**: Flash on/off as needed for best visibility
- **Offline Support**: Reports buffer locally if connectivity poor

### Voice-to-Text

- Learn equipment-specific terminology for accurate description
- Review transcribed text before submission
- Use voice notes for complex sequences of events

## Proactive Reporting

### Maintenance Alerts

- Report potential issues before full failure
- Include preventive maintenance recommendations
- Note unusual noises, vibrations, or performance changes

### Pattern Recognition

- Track recurring issues with specific equipment
- Note seasonal patterns or usage-related problems
- Suggest permanent solutions vs temporary fixes

## Communication Excellence

### Response Times

- Check reports daily for new provider communications
- Respond promptly to service provider questions
- Coordinate with contact person for on-site access

### Feedback Loop

- Provide post-repair feedback on timeliness/quality
- Request training for recurring report types
- Suggest improvements to reporting process

## Emergency Protocols

### Priority Levels

- **Critical**: Equipment failure affecting core business operations
- **High**: Safety concerns or customer-facing equipment
- **Medium**: Non-critical equipment with workarounds
- **Low**: Preventive notices or minor inconveniences

### Escalation Criteria

- Safety hazards: Report immediately regardless of time
- Customer impact: Prioritize based on revenue/business impact
- Equipment damage risk: Address before problem worsens

## Record Keeping

### Documentation Best Practices

- Save report IDs for follow-up reference
- Photograph service provider repairs for future reference
- Maintain personal troubleshooting log

### Performance Tracking

- Time from report to resolution
- Provider response quality
- Repeat issues requiring better initial reporting

## Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Integration

- Review completed reports monthly
- Identify patterns in successful vs unsuccessful repairs
- Adjust reporting habits based on what works best

### Team Collaboration

- Share successful reporting techniques
- Learn from colleagues' approaches
- Standardize best descriptions for common equipment types

## Final Checklist

- [ ] Fault description clear and detailed?
- [ ] Photos attached and clear?
- [ ] Right contact person selected?
- [ ] Urgency level matches business impact?
- [ ] All required fields completed?
- [ ] Reviewed for accuracy before submit?

Following these practices ensures smoother repair processes, better service provider relationships, and more efficient equipment maintenance.
