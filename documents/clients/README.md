# Client Documentation

As a client organization in the Fault Reporting Application, your team reports equipment faults and oversees the repair process. The system supports multiple roles with different permissions:

## User Roles

### Reporting Employee

- **Permissions**:
  - Create and submit new fault reports
  - View their own submitted reports
  - Edit reports before assignment to service providers
  - View job progress (after assignment)

### Site Budget Controller

- **Primary Role**: Manage team users and oversee all site operations
- **Additional Permissions** (beyond Reporting Employee):
  - Add/remove team members
  - Transfer budget controller role
  - Approve/reject service providers
  - Reassign jobs if declined
  - Approve quotes and confirm completion
  - View all site jobs and reports

## Getting Started

1. **Account Creation**: Site Budget Controllers set up new client accounts
2. **User Management**: Controllers add team members as needed
3. **Provider Selection**: Controllers choose approved service providers

## Key Workflows
