### ✅ [BUG] Service Provider Jobs Section Display Fix (Vue Slot Issue) - FIXED
**Source:** BUGS.md
**Commit:** c1da26e68ebd4438c93ebe8b9fe0929bbfae6e04
**Type:** Frontend

**Issue Fixed:**
Service provider jobs section was loading data but not displaying - job cards appeared empty. API returned 1 job correctly but UI showed nothing.

**Root Cause (Critical Vue.js Issue):**
- **Card Component Architecture:** Card.vue only renders named slots (`content`, `header`, `footer`) when `$slots` detects content
- **Template Structure Problem:** JobManagementSectionSP.vue was placing job content directly, not in `<template #content>`
- **Content Dropping:** Without proper slot placement, job data was discarded, resulting in empty card bodies

**Solution Implementation:**

1. **Debug Investigation Phase:**
   - Added temporary gray debug panel in card content area
   - Confirmed job data present: ID, status, item, client, technician details
   - Identified Card component renders: header (✓) + footer (✓) but content slot empty

2. **Critical Fix - Vue Template Slot Structure:**
```vue
<!-- BEFORE: Content not in proper Card slot -->
<div class="job-content p-4">job information here</div>

<!-- AFTER: Content properly wrapped in #content slot -->
<template #content>
  <div class="job-content p-4">
    <h3>{{ job.item_identifier }} - {{ job.fault_description }}</h3>
    <p>Client: {{ job.client_name }}</p>
    <p>Technician: {{ job.assigned_technician }}</p>
  </div>
</template>
```

**Additional Implementation:**
- Fixed modal button event handlers in ServiceProviderDashboard.vue
- `@view-job-details` now triggers job details modal
- `@edit-job` now opens job editing modal with technician assignment logic
- Proper modal state management for job details and editing workflows

**Resolution Outcome:**
- ✅ Jobs section displays complete job information
- ✅ Job cards show "Fridge" item, "Its hot" description, "Fighting Fires" client
- ✅ View/Edit buttons open respective modals correctly
- ✅ Status badges, date formatting, and responsive design fully functional

**Database Changes:**
- None (pure frontend Vue.js template structure fix)

**Build Notes:**
- Build completes successfully with `./snappy-build.sh` - no errors
- Fixed fundamental Vue.js component communication issue
- Template slot structure now matches Card.vue component expectations

**Testing:**
- ✅ Build succeeds without errors (`./snappy-build.sh`)
- ✅ Jobs data loads correctly from service-provider-jobs.php API
- ✅ Job cards display with professional formatting and complete information
- ✅ View and Edit buttons open modals with proper job data
- ✅ No console errors or missing component issues
- ✅ Responsive grid layout works across screen sizes

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/components/dashboard/JobManagementSectionSP.vue`
  - Wrapped job content in `<template #content>` slot for Card component
  - Added professional job information display formatting
  - Maintained existing button functionality and styling
- `frontend/src/views/ServiceProviderDashboard.vue`
  - Fixed job modal event handlers to open detail and edit modals
  - Added proper modal state management for job interactions

**Decisions Made:**
- Used Card component's standard slot architecture rather than bypassing it
- Maintained existing job data structure and formatting patterns
- Added modal event handlers for seamless user experience
- Clean debugging approach identified the root cause efficiently

**Gotchas / Issues:**
- Card.vue component requires strict slot naming convention
- Debug information confirmed data flow was working, isolated rendering issue
- Modal event handling must match emit names from child components

**Prevention:**
- Vue.js development should always verify component slot usage
- Card components should have clear slot documentation
- Job detail modals should be properly tested during component development

### ✅ [BUG] ServiceProviderDashboard.vue Critical Dashboard Fixes - FIXED
**Source:** BUGS.md
**Commit:** c1da26e
**Type:** Frontend

**Issues Fixed:**

2. **Business Profile Section Visibility**
   - Replaced BusinessProfileSectionSP component with inline template implementation

**Decisions Made:**
- Used inline template approach for profile section to ensure proper visibility control
- Implemented comprehensive debounced search functionality for performance

- Maintained existing design patterns and component structure

**Gotchas / Issues:**
- Original component visibility issues resolved by inline implementation
- Modal state management requires proper reactivity for proper user experience
- Service selection synchronization between methods critical for UX

**Prevention:**
- Component testing should include modal interaction testing
- Service modal methods should be thoroughly tested across different data scenarios
- Profile loading states provide better UX than empty sections
