### ✅ Geographic Enhancement System - Database Schema & Data Population [Full-stack]
**Commit:** [Pending commit]
**Type:** Full-stack

**Files Changed:**
- `geographic-enhancements.sql` - Comprehensive geographic database schema
- `region_hierarchy_completion.sql` - Region hierarchy relationships
- `regions_by_province_query.sql` - Geographic query utilities
- `populate-admin-data.sql` - Admin data population script

**Implementation Details:**
- Created comprehensive geographic database schema with 6 new tables:
  - `geographic_types` - Geographic classification types (province, municipality, suburb, etc.)
  - `geographic_boundaries` - Coordinate-based boundaries using MariaDB spatial features
  - `region_hierarchy` - Explicit hierarchical relationships between regions
  - `regional_classifications` - Traditional geographic regions (Bushveld, Karoo, etc.)
  - `geographic_search_cache` - Optimized search functionality
  - `geographic_analytics` - Geographic usage pattern tracking
- Enhanced existing `regions` and `locations` tables with geographic metadata
- Added comprehensive South African geographic data including provinces, cities, suburbs
- Implemented proper region hierarchy relationships for accurate geographic mapping
- Added regional classifications for traditional South African regions

**Database Changes:**
- 6 new tables with proper indexing and foreign key constraints
- Enhanced existing tables with geographic columns and metadata
- Comprehensive South African geographic dataset
- Proper hierarchical relationships between administrative divisions

**Build Notes:**
- Database schema changes require approval before implementation
- Geographic data provides foundation for location-based service provider matching
- Search optimization through caching and proper indexing

**Testing:**
- Database: Schema integrity, foreign key constraints, index performance
- Data: Geographic hierarchy accuracy, regional classifications
- Integration: Compatibility with existing region-based queries

**Decisions Made:**
- Used MariaDB spatial features for accurate geographic boundaries
- Implemented flexible hierarchy system supporting multiple relationship types
- Added comprehensive South African geographic coverage
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing region structure

**Gotchas / Issues:**
- Geographic data accuracy depends on proper hierarchy relationships
- Spatial queries require proper indexing for performance
- Large dataset population requires careful transaction management

**Next Steps:**
- Database schema approval and implementation
- Geographic search functionality development
- Location-based service provider matching features

### ✅ Admin Data Population System [Backend]
**Commit:** [Pending commit]
**Type:** Backend

**Files Changed:**
- `populate-admin-data.sql` - Comprehensive admin data script

**Implementation Details:**
- Populated `user_roles` table with complete role hierarchy (6 roles)
- Added comprehensive `regions` data for all major South African cities/towns (28 regions)
- Created extensive `services` catalog with 7 categories and 35 services:
  - Electrical (5 services), Plumbing (5 services), HVAC (5 services)
  - General Maintenance (5 services), Carpentry (5 services)
  - Painting (5 services), Roofing (5 services), Landscaping (5 services)
- Configured comprehensive `site_settings` with 35+ configuration options
- Implemented proper duplicate key handling for safe re-runs

**Database Changes:**
- Complete role hierarchy for user permissions
- Comprehensive geographic coverage for South Africa
- Full service catalog for fault reporting categories
- Site configuration for subscription tiers, billing, and system settings

**Build Notes:**
- Provides foundation data for full application functionality
- Supports subscription-based monetization model
- Configurable system settings for production deployment

**Testing:**
- Database: Data integrity, duplicate handling, referential integrity
- Configuration: Settings validation, type safety, default values
- Integration: Compatibility with existing user and service systems

**Decisions Made:**
- Comprehensive service catalog covering major home maintenance categories
- Three-tier subscription model (free, basic, advanced) with clear limits
- South African-centric configuration (ZAR currency, Johannesburg timezone)
- Flexible settings system supporting runtime configuration changes

**Gotchas / Issues:**
- Large data population requires transaction safety
- Service catalog may need periodic updates for new categories
- Site settings should be reviewed for production environment

**Next Steps:**
- Verify data integrity in development environment
- Review and customize settings for production deployment
- Update service catalog as needed for specific business requirements

### ✅ Phase 2: Missing Terminal States Implementation - Frontend Components [Frontend]
**Commit:** [Pending commit]
**Type:** Frontend

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/views/TechnicianDashboard.vue`
- `frontend/src/views/ClientDashboard.vue`

**Implementation Details:**
- Added "Cannot repair" status option to Technician Dashboard
- Added job confirmation/rejection UI to Client Dashboard for completed jobs
- Updated status badge styling across all dashboards for new terminal states
- Integrated with existing backend validation system
- Added proper modal interfaces for confirmation/rejection workflow

**Database Changes:**
- None (Frontend-only changes)

**Build Notes:**
- Frontend build should complete successfully with `./snappy-build.sh`
- All new components follow existing Vue.js patterns and styling
- Responsive design maintained across all screen sizes

**Testing:**
- Frontend: Status update forms, modal interactions, responsive layout
- Integration: API calls to job-status-update.php and job-completion-confirmation.php
- User Experience: Clear feedback messages and loading states

**Decisions Made:**
- Used existing modal patterns for consistency
- Maintained current permission structure (only budget controllers can confirm/reject)
- Added comprehensive validation and user feedback
- Followed existing CSS class naming conventions

**Gotchas / Issues:**
- Status validation handled by backend - frontend provides user-friendly error messages
- Modal state management requires careful cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Responsive design considerations for modal layouts on mobile devices

**Next Steps:**
- Test the complete workflow in browser
- Verify integration with backend APIs
- Update any remaining status displays if needed
- Run `./snappy-build.sh` to ensure build works correctly
