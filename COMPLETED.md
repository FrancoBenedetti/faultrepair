### ✅ Phase 2: Missing Terminal States Implementation - Frontend Components [Frontend]
**Commit:** [Pending commit]
**Type:** Frontend

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/views/TechnicianDashboard.vue`
- `frontend/src/views/ClientDashboard.vue`

**Implementation Details:**
- Added "Cannot repair" status option to Technician Dashboard
- Added job confirmation/rejection UI to Client Dashboard for completed jobs
- Updated status badge styling across all dashboards for new terminal states
- Integrated with existing backend validation system
- Added proper modal interfaces for confirmation/rejection workflow

**Database Changes:**
- None (Frontend-only changes)

**Build Notes:**
- Frontend build should complete successfully with `./snappy-build.sh`
- All new components follow existing Vue.js patterns and styling
- Responsive design maintained across all screen sizes

**Testing:**
- Frontend: Status update forms, modal interactions, responsive layout
- Integration: API calls to job-status-update.php and job-completion-confirmation.php
- User Experience: Clear feedback messages and loading states

**Decisions Made:**
- Used existing modal patterns for consistency
- Maintained current permission structure (only budget controllers can confirm/reject)
- Added comprehensive validation and user feedback
- Followed existing CSS class naming conventions

**Gotchas / Issues:**
- Status validation handled by backend - frontend provides user-friendly error messages
- Modal state management requires careful cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Responsive design considerations for modal layouts on mobile devices

**Next Steps:**
- Test the complete workflow in browser
- Verify integration with backend APIs
- Update any remaining status displays if needed
- Run `./snappy-build.sh` to ensure build works correctly
